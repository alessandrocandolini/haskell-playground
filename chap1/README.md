Topics:

1. Setup a new project using stack (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
2. Intro to the project structure: cabal file, stanzas; `app`, `test` and `src` folders; short intro to Haskell modules (bare minimum to understand the strcuture of the generated project, for now)
3. What are tyoes? Toy model of types as mathematical sets (naive, imprecise model) 
   * cardinality of types 
   * examples of simple sets with finite cardinality (eg, set of 0 elements, set of 1 element, set of 2 elements, etc)
2. Functions between types as mathematical functions between sets; the set (ie, type) of all functions from (type/set) A to (type/set) B
3. Motivation to FP: 2+2 = 4. Pure functions and referential transparency. Equational reasoning and refactoring, locality. (For more info, read the main README.md of the repo) 
4. Few basic types (Int, Char, Bool)
5. How to assing a value to a "variable", notice that a "Variable" does not imply mutation here
5. Define simple functions in Haskell (eg, `square` or `min`, or `identity`) 
6. A note on type inference (hindley milner type system) 
7. A note on curryied functions 
7. A note on constrained types, without going in depth for now (just to make sense of the type expressions) 
5. Types from other types, simple cases: additive types, multiplicative types and more general ADTs
6. A note on Haskell being not a nominal language
7. Pattern match and function definitions
8. A simple validation exercise
