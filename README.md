# haskell-playground

Collection of small projects to practise on a number of basic topics in Haskell, particularly 
* type-driven business and domain modelling (eg, through ADTs), from a naive to a more structural type-informed approach
* strenghts of polymorphic design (eg, theorems for free)
* stronger specifications and lawful abstractions
* basics of type level programming 

None of these are in any way case specific of haskell or strongly statically typed FP; however, strongly statically typed FP and particularly languages designed for that like Haskell are a natural fit for those topics
