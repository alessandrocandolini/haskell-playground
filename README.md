# haskell-playground

Collection of small projects to explore and practise a bit more on a number of basic topics in Haskell, particularly 
* type-driven business and domain modelling (eg, through ADTs and pure functions, but not only), from a naive to a more structural type-informed approach
* strenghts of polymorphic design (eg, theorems for free), including both parametric as well as ad-hoc polymorphism (the latter via type classes)
* stronger specifications and lawful abstractions
* basics of type level programming 

None of the above are in any way case specific of Haskell or strongly statically typed FP, and most of the approaches, ways of thinking and problem solving strategies can be (at least conceptually) ported to other languages too. Strongly statically typed well-designed purely functional languages like Haskell are particularly suitable to deal with those topics though. Strongly statically typed FP is well suited for a number of approaches to correctness like
* property based testing 
* compiler as a pour man mathematical verifier, to various degrees from basic types to liquid Haskell 
* propositon as types, and formal proof of correctness 

The repo will explore a number of examples, some particularly trivial, some hopefully a bit more advanced, the material is meant to be quite introducotry though.
