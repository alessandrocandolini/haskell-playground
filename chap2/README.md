# chap2

This chapter is mostly theoretical. It will build some concepts that we will leverage later: 
1. How to model optional types using parametrically polymorphic ADTs: the Maybe data type 
2. Simple functions on optional types (an exercise in pattern matching) 
2. Exaustive representation of the Json format specification using ADTs, as an example of recursive ADTs
2. Define a linked-list data structure using recursive (parametrically polymorphic) ADTs 
3. Simple (recursive) functions on lists 
4. The Haskell built-in list and some syntactic sugar 
5. Strings as [Char] 
6. More PBT on all these function properties (an exercise in looking for stronger properties and stronger specifications)
